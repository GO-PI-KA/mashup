<h3>Women entrepreneurs look to close the gender health care gap with new technology</h3>
<p>More than 60 million women in the United States are living with some form of heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But a 2018 study by the American Heart Association showed women are not getting the same level of care as men.</p>
<p>That trend has inspired more women entrepreneurs to develop technology specifically for women. 
Like Maayan Cohen, the CEO of Hello Heart, who designed a monitor to track everything from blood pressure and cholesterol to weight and activity. The data is sent in real time to an app, which is available through some employer health plans.</p>
<p>"We have AI-based digital coaching that helps you improve your health in real time. We also have risk alerts that help you catch risks in time," Cohen said.For these women, the mission is personal.
"My grandma, we lost her to a heart attack when I was only 13 years old," said Chong Rodriguez. "We need better tools, and now we can do something about it."</p>
