<h2>About</h2>
<hr>
<p> This website provides timely news coverage, expert opinion, and other information about recent and important events. They are often affiliated with newspapers, magazines, television networks, businesses, professional associations, user communities, or other entities. </p>
<p>There are two basic types of news sites: general and subject-specific. General news sites provide headlines and reporting about politics and government, the economy and markets, consumer technology, and weather and sports. They are designed to appeal to a wide audience, and often serve as extensions of traditional media outlets such as newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>Subject-specific news sites also provide breaking news and commentary, but focus upon a particular and often technical field or discipline. Engineering news sites and science news sites are two such examples.</p>
<p>News sites may provide original reporting, or aggregate content from other sources. For example, news sites that are extensions of television networks may feature news stories written by reporters assigned to various bureaus. These news articles may complement TV broadcasts, or provide original content. By contrast, news aggregators are web sites that capture headlines from other news organizations. They do not write and post their own content, nor are they staffed by news reporters. There are two types of Internet news aggregation: manual and automatic. </p>
