<h3>NCB seizes 3,500 kg drugs in Indian waters off Gujarat coast</h3>
<p>The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and the Indian Navy have seized the highest quantity of drugs—3500 kg—offshore to date worth over ₹1000 crore and arrested five men suspected to be from Pakistan or Iran from a ship in the Indian waters off the Gujarat coast, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gyaneshwar Singh, NCB’s deputy director general (operations), said the agency will share more details about the seizure later on Wednesday. “The five arrested men do not have identity papers. They are either from Iran or Pakistan. This is the highest ever seizure offshore [in terms of quantity] in the country,” Singh said.</p>
<p>The NCB has conducted three major operations in the Indian ocean with the Indian Navy over the last two years. In February 2022, they recovered 221 kg methamphetamine from a ship off Gujarat coast. Another 200 kg high grade heroin was seized from a ship near the Kerala coast in October 2022.</p>
